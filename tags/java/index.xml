      <description>Wordle Solver with Selenium 4 As a comparison, based upon my Wordle automation solution using Cypress, this time I&amp;rsquo;ve used Selenium 4 and Java 17 to solve the puzzle.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get into a full Selenium versus Cypress comparison here but I&amp;rsquo;d say both solutions work very well. Selenium has been around for many years but with version 4, the webdriver has been much improved with W3C compliance, integration with CDP (as Cypress uses) and relative locators for more stable scripts.</description>
