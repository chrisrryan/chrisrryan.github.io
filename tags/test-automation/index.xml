      <description>Wordle Solver with Cypress Wordle was taking so much time! Applying some automation to solving the daily puzzle&amp;hellip; So, I&amp;rsquo;ve written some test automation to play it for me with Cypress, JavaScript and a list of 2,309 words. Check out my approach, code and video of it in action&amp;hellip;
Yes, the world is playing it so I&amp;rsquo;ve succumbed. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing Wordle. It&amp;rsquo;s irresistible and you only get one word a day, all part of the magic.</description>

      <description>Wordle Solver with Selenium 4 As a comparison, based upon my Wordle automation solution using Cypress, this time I&amp;rsquo;ve used Selenium 4 and Java 17 to solve the puzzle.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get into a full Selenium versus Cypress comparison here but I&amp;rsquo;d say both solutions work very well. Selenium has been around for many years but with version 4, the webdriver has been much improved with W3C compliance, integration with CDP (as Cypress uses) and relative locators for more stable scripts.</description>
